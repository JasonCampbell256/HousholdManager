## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### **Meal Planning Architecture**
```csharp
// Weekly meal plan with automatic entry creation
public class MealPlan
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public DateTime WeekStartDate { get; set; }
    public int HouseholdId { get; set; }
    public ICollection<MealPlanEntry> Entries { get; set; } = new List<MealPlanEntry>();
}

// Individual meal assignments with flexibility
public class MealPlanEntry
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public MealTime MealTime { get; set; }
    public int? MealId { get; set; }           // Reference to existing meal
    public string? CustomMealName { get; set; }  // Or custom text
}
```

### **Advanced Blazor Patterns**
```csharp
// Dynamic week navigation with state management
private async Task LoadWeek(DateTime weekStart)
{
    currentMealPlan = await MealPlanService.CreateOrGetMealPlanAsync(householdId, weekStart);
    previousMealPlan = await MealPlanService.CreateOrGetMealPlanAsync(householdId, weekStart.AddDays(-7));
}

// Inline editing with meal suggestions
private void SearchMeals(string term)
{
    mealSuggestions = allMeals
        .Where(m => m.Name.Contains(term, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        .OrderBy(m => m.Name)
        .ToList();
}
```

### **Service Layer Integration**
```csharp
// Automatic meal plan creation with weekly structure
public async Task<MealPlan> CreateOrGetMealPlanAsync(int householdId, DateTime weekStartDate)
{
    var startOfWeek = GetStartOfWeek(weekStartDate);  // Sunday calculation
    // Creates 21 entries automatically (7 days √ó 3 meals)
}
```
